### Defination 
- a collection of nodes(vertices /vertex ) and edges that will connect pairs of nodes. 
- widely used in social networks , transportation network 

### Representation 
1. Adjacency List Representation : each node in the graph is associated with a list that contains its adjacent 
nodes. : more space efficient.
2. Adjacency Matrix Representation : a 2D matrix is used where each cell 'x[i][j]' represent the presence or 
absence of an edge between the nodes 'i' 'j'
